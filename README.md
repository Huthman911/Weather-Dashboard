# Weather Dashboard

## Project Overview
The **Weather Dashboard** is a React-based web application that allows users to search for and view current weather conditions in various cities using the OpenWeatherMap API. The app provides real-time weather updates and displays relevant details in an interactive and user-friendly interface.

## Features
- **Search Functionality:** Users can search for a city to retrieve its current weather conditions.
- **Random City Display:** On the landing page, the app fetches and displays weather details for a random city.
- **Weather Details Display:** Temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions are shown.
- **Error Handling:** Displays user-friendly error messages for incorrect city names or API errors.
- **Navigation:** Separate pages for the landing page and detailed weather information.
- **Real-Time API Integration:** Fetches live weather data from OpenWeatherMap.
- **Modular Components:** Reusable components such as `LandingPage` and `WeatherCard` for structured display.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React.js (with hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`)
- **Styling:** (To be added in the next phase)
- **API Integration:** OpenWeatherMap API
- **State Management:** React State Hooks
- **Routing:** React Router
- **Package Manager:** npm

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites:
